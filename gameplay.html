<h2>Welcome to Night Vale <small>A desert community.</small></h2>

<p>On the surface, <strong>Night Vale</strong> it's a desert town which gives the feeling of a hair over your eye that you just can't seem to brush off. Something just beyond view that's horribly wrong. Once you scratch a little part of the surface, you begin to see your perceptions are wrong. Night Vale contains <em>many</em> secrets.</p>

<p>The story centers around You, a man who found himself mysteriously in this strange town. Though an astronomical event, You left his fiancee and found his new found freedom to to reinvent himself. He has a job, moving strange crates around for an employer whom You does not know. But they pay You for services rendered, and You is content with that.</p>

<p>That is, until events involving a dog park and missing interns causes You to be more involved with the mysteries that center around Night Vale.</p>
