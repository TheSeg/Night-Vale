    <h4>The Player Character</h4>
    <p><strong>You is <em>not</em> the player.</strong> He is an actual character in Night Vale who is only referred to in second person.</p>
    <p>You's malleability to the narrative makes him the logical choice as the character the player controls and sees the narrative though; Also known as the Player Character. All other named and known characters have a unique enough personality or mystery in the narrative which would complicate the experience for listeners of the podcast. You is an outsider that live in Night Vale with the explicit purpose of reinventing himself.</p>
