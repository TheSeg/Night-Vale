<h2>Principal Characters</h2>

<h3>You <small>The Player Character</small></h3>

  <div class="col-sm-10">
    <p>The character of You is predominately featured in the episode <a href="http://nightvale.wikia.com/wiki/A_Story_About_You." title="Night Vale Wiki: A Story About You.">"A Story About You"</a> where Cecil narrates a day in You's life, broadcasted for all to hear.</p>

    <h4>The Player Character</h4>
    <p><strong>You is <em>not</em> the player.</strong> He is an actual character in Night Vale who is only referred to in second person.</p>
    <p>You's malleability to the narrative makes him the logical choice as the character the player controls and sees the narrative though; also known as the <em>player character</em>. All other named and known characters have a unique enough personality or mystery in the narrative which would complicate the experience for listeners of the podcast. You is an outsider that lives in Night Vale with the explicit purpose of reinventing himself.</p>

    <p><strong>Voiced by:</strong> <a href="http://resumes.actorsaccess.com/cecilbaldwin">Cecil Baldwin</a></p>
    <p>The voice of Night Vale, Cecil is the star character of the Night Vale series. With his unique and welcoming voice, Cecil has a positive disposition to his listeners even when the end of the world is upon the community -- which happens rather often in Night Vale.</p>
    <p>The most known character in the series, Cecil is the center identity of the world of Night Vale to the player. His allegiance to the listeners is the highest regard, unmatched to any other character. He identifies as a radio broadcaster and will take great risk in acting on his duties as a newscaster.</p>
    <h4>Physical Appearance</h4>
    <p>While there are no official images of any Night Vale character, there is a lot of indienty placed between the Cecil the character and the voice actor Cecil Baldwin.</p>
