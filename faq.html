<h2>Why did Seg make this proposal?</h2>
<p>I wanted to make an example of a game proposal for my portfolio which I would be comfortable to be read publicly. By using an existing <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>, I can be more forthcoming with my design as I didn't have the franchise to loose in the first place.</p>
<p>Of course, if I was offered the chance to make this an actual reality, I wouldn't need much convincing!</p>

<h2>Are Commonplace Books and the rest of the staff involved?</h2>
<p>No. This is completely independent of Commonplace Books, Joseph Fink, Jeffrey Cranor, and the rest of the production of Night Vale.</p>

<h2>Why isn't there more plot details with this proposal?</h2>
<p>In my experience, the more involved the people who made the original IP are involved, the better the game. What I provide is the framework of creating an interactive experience, but they provide the content to make a fulfilling piece of entertainment. While I have some sample screenplays to illustrate certain points, I would hope that Joseph Fink &amp; Jeffrey Cranor would focus on writing dialog.</p>

<h2>I want this to be a thing that exists! What can I do?</h2>
<p>It's really up to the people who make Night Vale. Though if you express interest to them&hellip;</p>

<h2>What platforms would see this game released on?</h2>
<p>Any platform. This project doesn't need anything exotic to run and the controls can be translated to a gamepad, touch interface, and keyboard &amp; mouse. The game is about the narrative content and most devices should be able to run it. Platform releases are more about the production bandwidth and business decisions.</p>
<p>But it won't work very well on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColecoVision" title="Wikipedia: ColecoVision" target="_blank">Coleco</a>. ;)</p>
